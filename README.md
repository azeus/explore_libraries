Explore Libraries Repository

This repository is a growing collection of Python libraries, categorized by their functionality. The goal is to document my journey as I explore and experiment with Pythonâ€™s vast ecosystem, including standard library modules and external libraries. The target? Exploring up to 500 libraries (maybe more?). Each section includes a brief description of the libraries, their use cases, and links to relevant documentation.

emoji_test.py

	â€¢	Description: Handle and process emoji in text data.

Networking Libraries

socket_test.py

	â€¢	Description: A demonstration of Pythonâ€™s built-in socket module for TCP and UDP communication. Includes examples for creating a server and client within the same script.
	â€¢	Documentation: Python socket Module Documentation

Utilities and Tools

random_pwd_gen.py

	â€¢	Description: Generate strong, customizable passwords. Allows users to specify the length and inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
	â€¢	Documentation: Python String Module Documentation

Movie Scraping and Rating Integration

movie_scraper.py

	â€¢	Description: Fetch movies released two months ago from Wikipedia and integrate with OMDb API to retrieve IMDb ratings and other metadata.
	â€¢	Documentation: OMDb API Documentation

Games

jenga.py

	â€¢	Description: A terminal-based Python implementation of Jenga. Players take turns removing blocks from the tower while trying to keep it stable. The game includes stability checks and random wobbles for added excitement.
	â€¢	Features:
	â€¢	Displays the towerâ€™s current state
	â€¢	Allows block removal by specifying row and column
	â€¢	Implements a random chance of the tower wobbling or collapsing
	â€¢	Documentation: Jenga Game Documentation

Generative Art

spinograph.py

	â€¢	Description: A script that generates spirograph patterns using mathematical formulas and Matplotlib for visualization.
	â€¢	Features:
	â€¢	Produces colorful spirographs based on random parameters
	â€¢	Customizable with radius, offset, and step values for unique designs
	â€¢	Dependencies: Matplotlib
	â€¢	Documentation: Matplotlib Documentation

Text Analysis Libraries

word_frequency.py

	â€¢	Description: A sophisticated text analysis toolkit focusing on word starting letter frequencies. Features include:
	â€¢	Statistical analysis of word starting letters
	â€¢	Visualization of frequency distributions
	â€¢	Text preprocessing and cleaning
	â€¢	Dependencies: Matplotlib, Typing, Collections, Re
	â€¢	Documentation: Built-in docstrings and type hints

Time and Life Visualizations

livedlife.py

	â€¢	Description: Calculate and visualize the percentage of the year passed and lifetime completed based on user input.
	â€¢	Features:
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Percentage of the current year passed based on todayâ€™s date.
	â€¢	Percentage of lifetime passed, given the userâ€™s age and an average lifespan (default: 80 years).
	â€¢	Visualization:
	â€¢	Progress Bars: Terminal-based visualization using tqdm.
	â€¢	Pie Charts: Displays passed vs. remaining time using matplotlib.
	â€¢	Dependencies: datetime, tqdm, matplotlib
	â€¢	Example Use Case:
	â€¢	Input age to see:
	â€¢	How much of the current year has passed.
	â€¢	What percentage of a lifetime is completed.
	â€¢	Visualize progress with engaging charts and progress bars.
	â€¢	Documentation: tqdm, Matplotlib

Notes
