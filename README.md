Explore Libraries Repository

This repository is a growing collection of Python libraries, categorized by their functionality. The goal is to document my journey as I explore and experiment with Pythonâ€™s vast ecosystem, including standard library modules and external libraries. The target? Exploring up to 500 libraries (maybe more?). Each section includes a brief description of the libraries, their use cases, and links to relevant documentation.

Games

Libraries and scripts for creating and playing games.
	â€¢	jenga.py
	â€¢	Description: A terminal-based Python implementation of Jenga. Players take turns removing blocks from the tower while trying to keep it stable. The game includes stability checks and random wobbles for added excitement.
	â€¢	Features:
	â€¢	Displays the towerâ€™s current state
	â€¢	Allows block removal by specifying row and column
	â€¢	Implements a random chance of the tower wobbling or collapsing
	â€¢	Documentation: Jenga Game Documentation

Generative Art

Libraries and scripts for creating algorithmic art and visual patterns.
	â€¢	spinograph.py
